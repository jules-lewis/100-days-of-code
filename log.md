# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: March 3, 2020

**Goal: Round 1**: Complete [Python and Django Full Stack Web Developer Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-and-django-full-stack-web-developer-bootcamp/) from Udemy.

**Today's Progress**: Getting things together for the challenge, defining goal, building environment. Made public commitment on Twitter, forked this repo.

**Thoughts:** Really hesitated to publicly commit because I have struggled with challenges beyond 30 days in the past, and have failed to complete the Udemy course previously. Got through about 25% before, and unsure why it got away from me (the material is interesting!).

### Day 1: March 4, 2020

**Goal: Round 1**: Complete [Python and Django Full Stack Web Developer Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-and-django-full-stack-web-developer-bootcamp/) from Udemy.

**Today's Progress**: Covered up to HTML basic elements: headings, anchor, p, img, lists, div, span. Watched the course and coded along at 1.5x speed, as this feels really familiar -- good feature of Udemy is the ability to play material at varying speeds. Sections 1-3 complete.

**Thoughts:** Feels good to get started (again), but feel like I might need a separate challenge (within the 100 days) to keep coding interesting. Maybe alternate days on Udemy with days working on a Python project?
