# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 7: March 10, 2020

**Goal: Round 1**: Complete [Python and Django Full Stack Web Developer Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-and-django-full-stack-web-developer-bootcamp/) from Udemy.

**Today's Progress**: Basic introduction to JavaScript: variables, control flow, operators etc.

**Thoughts:** That was a long session, but I wanted to get through the whole introduction!

### Day 6: March 9, 2020

**Goal: Round 1**: Complete [Python and Django Full Stack Web Developer Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-and-django-full-stack-web-developer-bootcamp/) from Udemy.

**Today's Progress**: More Bootstrap, including jumbotron, card, flexgrid.

**Thoughts:** Some things are really easy with the documentation on the official [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) page, but little things can be really frustrating. Had to Google around to find out how to centre a button, and added an empty `<p></p>` pair to add some vertical spacing with using the `<hr>` tag.

### Day 5: March 8, 2020

**Goal: Round 1**: Complete [Python and Django Full Stack Web Developer Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-and-django-full-stack-web-developer-bootcamp/) from Udemy.

**Today's Progress**: Introduction to Bootstrap: form controls, navbar.

**Thoughts:** Difficult to marry the course video with the new classes in Bootstrap 4, but muddled through. The examples on the Bootstrap site are very helpful!

### Day 4: March 7, 2020

**Goal: Round 1**: Complete [Python and Django Full Stack Web Developer Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-and-django-full-stack-web-developer-bootcamp/) from Udemy.

**Today's Progress**: More CSS: fonts and the box model.

**Thoughts:** Another early start! Struggling a bit with the box model. Ended up using a white border on cells in a table to space them out, as margin property seems to be overwritten by the table's auto margin. Inheritance? Will play some more.

### Day 3: March 6, 2020

**Goal: Round 1**: Complete [Python and Django Full Stack Web Developer Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-and-django-full-stack-web-developer-bootcamp/) from Udemy.

**Today's Progress**: CSS basics: simple selectors: element, class, id, attribute.

**Thoughts:** Had to plan well ahead to give myself time to complete today's coding, so I'm very happy to have achieved this.

### Day 2: March 5, 2020

**Goal: Round 1**: Complete [Python and Django Full Stack Web Developer Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-and-django-full-stack-web-developer-bootcamp/) from Udemy.

**Today's Progress**: Covered rest of HTML basics: tables and forms. Motoring through as everything still feels familiar. Section 4 complete, beginning CSS tomorrow.

**Thoughts:** Scheduling is going to be interesting in this challenge. Already have a full day tomorrow, so fitting in an hour of coding will be tough. On the coding side, it's interesting to see how awful unstyled HTML looks, CSS is doing some **heavy** lifting on today's web!

### Day 1: March 4, 2020

**Goal: Round 1**: Complete [Python and Django Full Stack Web Developer Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-and-django-full-stack-web-developer-bootcamp/) from Udemy.

**Today's Progress**: Covered up to HTML basic elements: headings, anchor, p, img, lists, div, span. Watched the course and coded along at 1.5x speed, as this feels really familiar -- good feature of Udemy is the ability to play material at varying speeds. Sections 1-3 complete.

**Thoughts:** Feels good to get started (again), but feel like I might need a separate challenge (within the 100 days) to keep coding interesting. Maybe alternate days on Udemy with days working on a Python project?

### Day 0: March 3, 2020

**Goal: Round 1**: Complete [Python and Django Full Stack Web Developer Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-and-django-full-stack-web-developer-bootcamp/) from Udemy.

**Today's Progress**: Getting things together for the challenge, defining goal, building environment. Made public commitment on Twitter, forked this repo.

**Thoughts:** Really hesitated to publicly commit because I have struggled with challenges beyond 30 days in the past, and have failed to complete the Udemy course previously. Got through about 25% before, and unsure why it got away from me (the material is interesting!).
