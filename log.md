# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 52: May 4, 2020  

**Goal: Round 1**: Build a coding streak of seven straight days.

**Today's Progress**: More [Corey Schafer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qu3dThVy6KQ), this time on `itertools` (great module), but no clearer on how I'm going to produce Regular Numbers quickly! If anyone has any tips on lazy generators...??

**Thoughts:** Not sure if watching coding tutorials counts as 'coding'?

### Day 51: May 3, 2020  

**Goal: Round 1**: Build a coding streak of seven straight days.

**Today's Progress**: Reading Python docs and watched [Corey Schafer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTYiNjvnHZY) on iterators and generators because my code is too slow! Next up, itertools!

**Thoughts:** Realising how little of the standard modules I actually know about...

### Day 50: May 2, 2020  

**Goal: Round 1**: Build a coding streak of seven straight days.

**Today's Progress**: Worked on CodeWars "Hamming Numbers". Happy with the code, and it passes the tests, but not quickly enough for CodeWars -- need to work on performance!

**Thoughts:** Difficult to get in front of the computer for this, but once I sat down with VSCode I really enjoyed coding! (My brain seems to work the same way with running!)

### Day 49: May 1, 2020  

**Goal: Round 1**: Build a coding streak of seven straight days.

**Today's Progress**: Completed CodeWars "Alphabetic Anagrams" challenge.

**Thoughts:** Only needed to change one line from the pseudo-code, to deal with rounding. Good puzzle.

**Link to work:** [alphabetic-anagrams.py](https://github.com/jules-lewis/codewars/blob/master/3kyu/alphabetic-anagrams.py)


### Day 48: April 30, 2020  

**Goal: Round 1**: Build a coding streak of seven straight days.

**Today's Progress**: Worked on CodeWars challenge of the week: "Alphabetic Anagrams" -- mostly pseudo-code, but it seems to work!

**Thoughts:** Nice puzzle, because it evolves as you look at it. It initially reads like a word puzzle, but the tests are set up to prevent brute force. It turns out to be a mathematical puzzle, which forces you to look at permutations. The added twist is dealing with the puzzle including words with repeated letters, so the answer to "CDEJM" is different to the answer to "CDEEM" (as there are fewer unique permutations of the second word).

**Link to work:** *in progress on Repl.it...*


### Day 47: April 29, 2020  

**Goal: Round 1**: Build a coding streak of seven straight days.

**Today's Progress**: Completed CodeWars kata "Sudoku Solver"

**Thoughts:** Once again there are published solutions of very few lines, but they're virtually unreadable and they're of no use to a maintainer somewhere down the line. Decided I won't be returning to the Django course until I've got a need to develop at the back end.

**Link to work:** [sudoku-solver.py](https://github.com/jules-lewis/codewars/blob/master/3kyu/sudoku-solver.py)


### Missed Day: April 28, 2020  

**Thoughts:** Seems to happen more when I'm working late shifts; the mornings where I imagine I'll have so much 'free' time actually pass quite quickly!


### Day 46: April 27, 2020  

**Goal: Round 1**: \[*Still thinking...*\] Complete [Python and Django Full Stack Web Developer Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-and-django-full-stack-web-developer-bootcamp/) from Udemy.

**Today's Progress**: Progress on CodeWars kata "Sudoku Solver"

**Thoughts:** Coming together -- might not be the most terse code, but it's good to write a solver for something I enjoy doing in real life!

**Link to work:** [sudoku-solver.py](https://github.com/jules-lewis/codewars/blob/master/3kyu/sudoku-solver.py) *- work in progress*


### Day 45: April 26, 2020  

**Goal: Round 1**: \[*Still thinking...*\] Complete [Python and Django Full Stack Web Developer Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-and-django-full-stack-web-developer-bootcamp/) from Udemy.

**Today's Progress**: Little tinker with CodeWars: "Sudoku Solver"

**Thoughts:** Motivation not great today... other priorities.

**Link to work:** [rail-fence-cipher.py](https://github.com/jules-lewis/codewars/blob/master/4kyu/rail-fence-cypher.py)


### Day 44: April 25, 2020  

**Goal: Round 1**: \[*Still thinking...*\] Complete [Python and Django Full Stack Web Developer Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-and-django-full-stack-web-developer-bootcamp/) from Udemy.

**Today's Progress**: Completed "Rail Fence Cipher" and levelled up on CodeWars!

**Thoughts:** The pseudo-code worked, and it was great to see it working. Of course, I then submitted my code to CodeWars to find that others have implemented the same functions with a quarter (or less) of the code. Looks like I need to learn about some of the `itertools`, particularly `chain` and `cycle`.

### Day 43: April 24, 2020  

**Goal: Round 1**: \[*Still thinking...*\] Complete [Python and Django Full Stack Web Developer Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-and-django-full-stack-web-developer-bootcamp/) from Udemy.

**Today's Progress**: Worked out how to complete "Rail Fence Cipher" and paper-coded it (is that a thing? pseudo coded?). Feels really easy now I've worked out an implementation that uses similar structures both Encode and Decode.

**Thoughts:** Great to write code in my head and on paper without getting bogged down in syntax. Feels like the implementation with be a doddle tomorrow. Famous last words?? My coding thoughts can be found in the comments at the top of the module, below.

### Day 42: April 23, 2020  

**Goal: Round 1**: [Thinking about this...] Complete [Python and Django Full Stack Web Developer Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-and-django-full-stack-web-developer-bootcamp/) from Udemy.

**Today's Progress**: Completed CodeWars Kata "Ranking Poker Hands" which was great fun because it took code I had written for Project Euler nearly three years ago, and implemented it as a class.

**Thoughts:** Really good fun and I got to try some things I've not done with classes before (at least that I can remember), including private functions and class level constants. 

**Link to work:** [CodeWars Source](https://github.com/jules-lewis/codewars)


### Day 41: April 22, 2020  

**Goal: Round 1**: Complete [Python and Django Full Stack Web Developer Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-and-django-full-stack-web-developer-bootcamp/) from Udemy.

**Today's Progress**: Had a brief look at Django templates and relative URLs. Paused because reasons (see Thoughts below) and added a repo for my CodeWars katas. Then bashed my head against the Rail Fence Cipher kata for an hour! 

**Thoughts:** Had a look at the next stage of Django, and really struggling to convince myself to go on. I'm starting to feel like I need to learn Django when I actually have a full stack project idea to motivate me. It's really starting to feel like knowledge for its own sake, and without a reason to apply the knowledge it's going to get rusty before I get to use it. A lot ot the templating ideas feel like they appear in static site generators which probably have more direct application for me at the moment. Retreated to CodeWars for now, before completely abandoning the course. Then stuggled with what looks like a simple cipher!

### Day 40: April 21, 2020  

**Goal: Round 1**: Complete [Python and Django Full Stack Web Developer Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-and-django-full-stack-web-developer-bootcamp/) from Udemy.

**Today's Progress**: CodeWars kata today, got to the computer fairly late in the day. Used collections.Counter() again, to solve top_three_words().

**Thoughts:** Good to hit two days in a row, not sure if I'm making best use of my time. Need to get back to the Django.


### Day 39: April 20(*), 2020  

**Goal: Round 1**: Complete [Python and Django Full Stack Web Developer Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-and-django-full-stack-web-developer-bootcamp/) from Udemy.

**Today's Progress**: Came back to Codewars and completed Scramblies kata, as I had read about Counter(). Then went back to Django and hooked up a (model) form to a model -- great fun!

**Thoughts:** Missed two days due to working long late shifts -- don't know where the weekend went! Good to get back to coding.


### Missed Days: April 18 & 19, 2020  

**Thoughts:** Late shifts again!


### Day 38: April 17, 2020  

**Goal: Round 1**: Complete [Python and Django Full Stack Web Developer Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-and-django-full-stack-web-developer-bootcamp/) from Udemy.

**Today's Progress**: Codewars as I didn't have enough bandwidth to run Udemy â˜¹. Managed to level up though, which was nice!

**Thoughts:** Even Codewars was kicking my ass, though it's fun. Really struggled with Scramblies kata (5kyu).


### Day 37: April 16, 2020  

**Goal: Round 1**: Complete [Python and Django Full Stack Web Developer Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-and-django-full-stack-web-developer-bootcamp/) from Udemy.

**Today's Progress**: Django form validation.

**Thoughts:** Not the most fun session: here's how you can validate a field, now here's the Django built in validation! Bit of CodeWars to cheer up, methinks!

**Goal: Round 1**: Complete [Python and Django Full Stack Web Developer Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-and-django-full-stack-web-developer-bootcamp/) from Udemy.

**Today's Progress**: Long day at work and still struggling with mojo, so I did a couple of hours on Codewars.

**Thoughts:** It's fun but it doesn't feel like progress - back to Django tomorrow!

**Goal: Round 1**: Complete [Python and Django Full Stack Web Developer Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-and-django-full-stack-web-developer-bootcamp/) from Udemy.

**Today's Progress**: Django recap: populated new model, filled it with fake data, and displayed it in a view.

**Thoughts:** Have had some helpful input for Django programmers, but still with URLPatterns for many views in one app.

**Link to work:** [Round 1 Source](https://github.com/jules-lewis/100-days-src-round1)


### Day 29: April 8, 2020  

**Goal: Round 1**: Complete [Python and Django Full Stack Web Developer Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-and-django-full-stack-web-developer-bootcamp/) from Udemy.

**Today's Progress**: Trying to debug my project so I don't need to create a new app every time I want a new view! Also started a side project in Python to keep me actually coding.

**Thoughts:** Still struggling a bit with views; feels like it should be easier than this! Probably missing something obvious...

**Link to work:** [Round 1 Source](https://github.com/jules-lewis/100-days-src-round1)


### Day 28: April 7, 2020  

**Goal: Round 1**: Complete [Python and Django Full Stack Web Developer Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-and-django-full-stack-web-developer-bootcamp/) from Udemy.

**Today's Progress**: Recap exercise with Django: started creating new view (Users).

**Thoughts:** Struggling to find out how to add a second view to the same app; currently creating a new app per subdomain - is that right?.

**Link to work:** [Round 1 Source](https://github.com/jules-lewis/100-days-src-round1)


### Missed Days: March 27 to April 1, 2020  

**Thoughts:** Coronavirus stopped play! Didn't get Covid-19 but have had to move out to to having a vulnerable family member. Very poor access to internet and forcibly adjusted priorities... will be back to it soon.


### Day 23: Also March 26(!), 2020  

**Goal: Round 1**: Complete [Python and Django Full Stack Web Developer Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-and-django-full-stack-web-developer-bootcamp/) from Udemy.

**Today's Progress**: Django models and database.

**Thoughts:** Created first SQL database for many years -- very easy when you let Django do it for you!

**Link to work:** [Round 1 Source](https://github.com/jules-lewis/100-days-src-round1)


### Day 22: March 26(!), 2020

**Goal: Round 1**: Complete [Python and Django Full Stack Web Developer Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-and-django-full-stack-web-developer-bootcamp/) from Udemy.

**Today's Progress**: Django templates and views -- feels like a steep learning curve again!

**Thoughts:** Still having to work through some differences between the course content and the current version of Django... muddle through though!

**Link to work:** [Round 1 Source](https://github.com/jules-lewis/100-days-src-round1)


### Day 20: March 23, 2020  

**Goal: Round 1**: Complete [Python and Django Full Stack Web Developer Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-and-django-full-stack-web-developer-bootcamp/) from Udemy.

**Today's Progress**: First exposure to Django today! Installed Django, made first project, first app, ran a server and it all worked!

**Thoughts:** Had to work around a lot of differences between the course content and where Django is now; also I'm not using Anaconda so I had to work out how to do some things manually. Also I'm running VSCode rather than Atom, so constantly dealing with little differences. Got there in the end!

**Link to work:** [Round 1 Source](https://github.com/jules-lewis/100-days-src-round1)


### Day 19: March 22, 2020  ðŸ˜¢

**Goal: Round 1**: Complete [Python and Django Full Stack Web Developer Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-and-django-full-stack-web-developer-bootcamp/) from Udemy.

**Today's Progress**: No coding today -- some real life stuff came up that took precedence... No harm done.

**Thoughts:** Back at it tomorrow! 

**Link to work:** [Round 1 Source](https://github.com/jules-lewis/100-days-src-round1)


### Day 18: March 21, 2020 <-- Equinox!

**Goal: Round 1**: Complete [Python and Django Full Stack Web Developer Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-and-django-full-stack-web-developer-bootcamp/) from Udemy.

**Today's Progress**: No actual code in the course -- very front-loaded presentation of exceptions, regular expressions, modules, decorators, and `__name__ == "__main__"`! Quite a lot to take in... Did one small bit of programming, which was to help my son reference a global variable in a function.

**Thoughts:** Will be good to actually practice some of these concepts -- wonder if it's worth writing something with decorators and error handling...?

**Link to work:** [Round 1 Source](https://github.com/jules-lewis/100-days-src-round1)


### Day 17: March 20, 2020

**Goal: Round 1**: Complete [Python and Django Full Stack Web Developer Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-and-django-full-stack-web-developer-bootcamp/) from Udemy.

**Today's Progress**: Python objects -- finished off the War game, which had a couple of bugs. Also spent some time helping my son, who's taken a bit of interest in Python recently.

**Thoughts:** Good to iron out a few bugs, such as calling a method as if it had been an attribute. Great to see my son being able to write code with very few prompts. He's basically writing very imperative functions, but I'm letting this go while he gets familiar with Python 'grammar'. Colons are currently his enemy!

### Day 16: March 19, 2020

**Goal: Round 1**: Complete [Python and Django Full Stack Web Developer Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-and-django-full-stack-web-developer-bootcamp/) from Udemy.

**Today's Progress**: Python objects -- haven't really played round with objects (in Python, I did a bit of C++ in another life).

**Thoughts:** Finished in the early hours again: very hard to spend **just** an hour coding! Seemed to go okay -- built a little implementation of a card game (War). Got it completely functional, and now off to see how Jose implemented it (probably using a *lot* less code!). The tricky thing was trying to use the same code for normal comparisons *and* the unusual situation when both players' cards match.

### Day 15: March 18, 2020

**Goal: Round 1**: Complete [Python and Django Full Stack Web Developer Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-and-django-full-stack-web-developer-bootcamp/) from Udemy.

**Today's Progress**: More Python revision -- got to build a little 'Mastermind' game today, great fun!

**Thoughts:** Really enjoyed building a game from start to finish; felt like being back in coding club!

**Link to work:** [Round 1 Source](https://github.com/jules-lewis/100-days-src-round1)


### Day 14: March 17, 2020

**Goal: Round 1**: Complete [Python and Django Full Stack Web Developer Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-and-django-full-stack-web-developer-bootcamp/) from Udemy.

**Today's Progress**: Python refresher: functions.

**Thoughts:** Still enjoying being on home turf!

**Link to work:** [Round 1 Source](https://github.com/jules-lewis/100-days-src-round1)


### Day 13: March 16, 2020

**Goal: Round 1**: Complete [Python and Django Full Stack Web Developer Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-and-django-full-stack-web-developer-bootcamp/) from Udemy.

**Today's Progress**: Python refresher.

**Thoughts:** Nice to be running through something I feel like I already know!

### Day 12: March 15, 2020

**Goal: Round 1**: Complete [Python and Django Full Stack Web Developer Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-and-django-full-stack-web-developer-bootcamp/) from Udemy.

**Today's Progress**: jQuery -- writing a front-end game (Connect 4) with a mixture of vanilla JavaScript and jQuery.

**Thoughts:** Well that 'hour' lasted two and a half hours but I hardly noticed the time. Coded through the example in the course and fixed a couple of bugs in the existing code. For example, if a player clicks on a full column he loses his go, and other game end conditions weren't really being handled. Really happy with how it turned out; it's basically a working Connect 4 game!

### Day 11: March 14, 2020

**Goal: Round 1**: Complete [Python and Django Full Stack Web Developer Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-and-django-full-stack-web-developer-bootcamp/) from Udemy.

**Today's Progress**: Starting to pull it all together, with the start of a TIC-TAC-TOE 'app' (look int the repo). 

**Thoughts:** Today's work took longer than an hour, and I wasted a lot of time by not knowing enough about this, but got there in the end!

**Link to work:** [Round 1 Source](https://github.com/jules-lewis/100-days-src-round1)


### Day 10: March 13, 2020

**Goal: Round 1**: Complete [Python and Django Full Stack Web Developer Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-and-django-full-stack-web-developer-bootcamp/) from Udemy.

**Today's Progress**: JavaScript objects, and a brief look at the DOM.

**Thoughts:** Ten percent of the way through the challenge, this is the nearest I've got to skipping a day! Not sure what got me back to the keyboard. Public accountability may be part of it!

**Link to work:** [Round 1 Source](https://github.com/jules-lewis/100-days-src-round1)


### Day 9: March 12, 2020

**Goal: Round 1**: Complete [Python and Django Full Stack Web Developer Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-and-django-full-stack-web-developer-bootcamp/) from Udemy.

**Today's Progress**: JavaScript arrays: push, remove, splice, indexof, length. 'Objects' tomorrow (dictionaries).

**Thoughts:** Keep thinking of JavaScript in terms of Python! For example, iteration feels more natural in Python, but then I'm only a few days into learning JS. I'm sure if I had learned JS first, I'd think the same about some aspects of Python?

### Day 8: March 11, 2020

**Goal: Round 1**: Complete [Python and Django Full Stack Web Developer Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-and-django-full-stack-web-developer-bootcamp/) from Udemy.

**Today's Progress**: Practising functions today -- back to the console for now.

**Thoughts:** I'm now 30% through the course, which is further than I got before. I think having a daily habit helps, plus the fact that I'm going through it a lot quicker this time!

**Link to work:** [Round 1 Source](https://github.com/jules-lewis/100-days-src-round1)


### Day 7: March 10, 2020

**Goal: Round 1**: Complete [Python and Django Full Stack Web Developer Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-and-django-full-stack-web-developer-bootcamp/) from Udemy.

**Today's Progress**: Basic introduction to JavaScript: variables, control flow, operators etc.

**Thoughts:** That was a long session, but I wanted to get through the whole introduction!

**Link to work:** [Round 1 Source](https://github.com/jules-lewis/100-days-src-round1)


### Day 6: March 9, 2020

**Goal: Round 1**: Complete [Python and Django Full Stack Web Developer Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-and-django-full-stack-web-developer-bootcamp/) from Udemy.

**Today's Progress**: More Bootstrap, including jumbotron, card, flexgrid.

**Thoughts:** Some things are really easy with the documentation on the official [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) page, but little things can be really frustrating. Had to Google around to find out how to centre a button, and added an empty `<p></p>` pair to add some vertical spacing with using the `<hr>` tag.

### Day 5: March 8, 2020

**Goal: Round 1**: Complete [Python and Django Full Stack Web Developer Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-and-django-full-stack-web-developer-bootcamp/) from Udemy.

**Today's Progress**: Introduction to Bootstrap: form controls, navbar.

**Thoughts:** Difficult to marry the course video with the new classes in Bootstrap 4, but muddled through. The examples on the Bootstrap site are very helpful!

### Day 4: March 7, 2020

**Goal: Round 1**: Complete [Python and Django Full Stack Web Developer Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-and-django-full-stack-web-developer-bootcamp/) from Udemy.

**Today's Progress**: More CSS: fonts and the box model.

**Thoughts:** Another early start! Struggling a bit with the box model. Ended up using a white border on cells in a table to space them out, as margin property seems to be overwritten by the table's auto margin. Inheritance? Will play some more.

### Day 3: March 6, 2020

**Goal: Round 1**: Complete [Python and Django Full Stack Web Developer Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-and-django-full-stack-web-developer-bootcamp/) from Udemy.

**Today's Progress**: CSS basics: simple selectors: element, class, id, attribute.

**Thoughts:** Had to plan well ahead to give myself time to complete today's coding, so I'm very happy to have achieved this.

### Day 2: March 5, 2020

**Goal: Round 1**: Complete [Python and Django Full Stack Web Developer Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-and-django-full-stack-web-developer-bootcamp/) from Udemy.

**Today's Progress**: Covered rest of HTML basics: tables and forms. Motoring through as everything still feels familiar. Section 4 complete, beginning CSS tomorrow.

**Thoughts:** Scheduling is going to be interesting in this challenge. Already have a full day tomorrow, so fitting in an hour of coding will be tough. On the coding side, it's interesting to see how awful unstyled HTML looks, CSS is doing some **heavy** lifting on today's web!

### Day 1: March 4, 2020

**Goal: Round 1**: Complete [Python and Django Full Stack Web Developer Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-and-django-full-stack-web-developer-bootcamp/) from Udemy.

**Today's Progress**: Covered up to HTML basic elements: headings, anchor, p, img, lists, div, span. Watched the course and coded along at 1.5x speed, as this feels really familiar -- good feature of Udemy is the ability to play material at varying speeds. Sections 1-3 complete.

**Thoughts:** Feels good to get started (again), but feel like I might need a separate challenge (within the 100 days) to keep coding interesting. Maybe alternate days on Udemy with days working on a Python project?

### Day 0: March 3, 2020

**Goal: Round 1**: Complete [Python and Django Full Stack Web Developer Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-and-django-full-stack-web-developer-bootcamp/) from Udemy.

**Today's Progress**: Getting things together for the challenge, defining goal, building environment. Made public commitment on Twitter, forked this repo.

**Thoughts:** Really hesitated to publicly commit because I have struggled with challenges beyond 30 days in the past, and have failed to complete the Udemy course previously. Got through about 25% before, and unsure why it got away from me (the material is interesting!).
